```
in a terminal/console window.

- To get Node.js, go to 
```sh
nodejs.org.
```

- Download and install the LTS version of node.

## Angular CLI

We use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
